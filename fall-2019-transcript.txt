Mallory Hennigar (mahennig@syr.edu)
This course introduces Hindu traditions and practices. We move between cosmological, theological and philosophical understandings, and the ways these motivate ordinary and extraordinary human lives. We see these understandings expressed through myth and moral teachings, storytelling and poetry, ritual and devotion. Throughout the course we remain interested in contemporary Indian society where Hinduism's many streams of thought have ongoing significance.

REL 255 Psychology, Spirituality, Ethics and Love
Fall 2019 Tuesday/Thursday, 2:00-3:20PM
Prof. Ernest Wallwork

This course invites you to look at your own and others’ dreams, loves, conflicts, moral beliefs and religious practices from the perspective of the unconscious passions at play. Drawing on the clinical findings of Freud, Jung, Fromm, Erikson and contemporary psycho- analysts, the course investigates various aspects of unconsciously-motivated conduct. The main criticisms that depth psychological theorists have directed at conventional religion and morality are considered alongside the guidance that these same theorists
offer regarding how to live and what to believe.

Professor: M. Gail Hamner

In concert with the Humanities Center Symposium’s 2019 theme of silence, this class looks at how silent films image religious traditions and themes; how films engage silence as a religious practice or context; how films suggest the religious value of “nature” and “civilization” through different soundscapes and silentscapes; and how the silence of censorship or resistance is often coded as “religious”.

Slide 34
REL 165 Discovering Islam
Professor Ahmed Abdel-Meguid
Summer 2019, Online
What is the reality of Islam as a faith a culture and an intellectual worldview?
Discovering Islam answers this question in three steps. The first step examines the formation of Islamic Civilization in the pre-modern era starting with the life of Prophet Muhammad, turning to a brief investigation of the two sources of Islam (Qur'an and Sunna--the tradition of the prophet) and then investigating how the Islamic sciences and traditions translated their tenets into a unique way of living and thinking. The second step of the course further explores the heart of classic Islamic thought and the conception of the relation among Islamic sciences at the height of Islamic Civilization. The Third and last step of the course will examine the Islamic conception of ethics and politics. In this vein, it will compare and contrast classical and contemporary perspectives  on these central problems focusing on present day challenges.
